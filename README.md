# Modern Start Page

A modern, customizable browser start page built with Astro and React. Features a clean UI, multiple search engines, theme switching, and persistent configuration. Perfect for self-hosted server dashboards and new tab pages.

> **Note:** This project was heavily influenced by [SUI](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/sui), a start page that served as my daily driver for many years. After 5-6 years since its last update, I decided to modernize the concept with current web technologies while maintaining its core functionality and simplicity.

## Features

- üé® Multiple pre-defined themes with easy customization
- üîç Support for multiple search engines
- üì± Responsive design that works on all devices
- üì¶ Simple JSON-based configuration
- üê≥ Easy Docker deployment
- üîÑ Persistent configuration with file-based storage
- üéØ Clean, modern UI with Lucide icons
- ‚ö° Fast and lightweight
- üå§Ô∏è Widget support (Weather, Clock, and more to come)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenWeather API key (for weather widget)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericblue/modern-start-page.git
cd modern-start-page
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your OpenWeather API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenWeather API key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

The application uses a simple JSON file storage system for configuration. Here's the default configuration structure:

```json
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "id": "default",
      "name": "Default",
      "categories": [
        {
          "name": "Development",
          "displayMode": "icon",
          "links": [
            {
              "name": "GitHub",
              "url": "https://github.com",
              "icon": "github"
            },
            {
              "name": "GitLab",
              "url": "https://gitlab.com",
              "icon": "gitlab"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "Social",
          "displayMode": "icon",
          "links": [
            {
              "name": "Twitter",
              "url": "https://twitter.com",
              "icon": "twitter"
            },
            {
              "name": "Reddit",
              "url": "https://reddit.com",
              "icon": "reddit"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "activeContext": "default",
  "theme": "dark",
  "gridColumns": 4,
  "displayMode": "icon",
  "showCategoryBorders": true,
  "widgets": {
    "weather": {

      "showSeconds": true
    }
